Healthcare Project - Patient Data REST API

The HealthMatic application will be used by the health practitioners in the hospital to monitor or track patientâ€™s record. 
There will be four types of users who will be using the app that will have different roles, these are the admin, doctors, 
nurses, and the lab technicians.

All of the patients and health practitioners data used by the HealthMatic application shall be saved in the MongoDB. 
The data shall be stored and retrieved by using the HTTP POST and GET methods that will be sent to the Data Server. The data 
server shall use Node.js and the RESTify framework to process the different requests from the HealthMatic application client. 
It will also interact with the MongoDB through Mongoose framework to access the patients and health practitioners data.
